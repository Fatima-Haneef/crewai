# CrewAI Agents with Google Gemini Integration

Welcome to the CrewAI Agents project â€“ a hands-on collection of Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating how to build intelligent, multi-agent systems using CrewAI and Google Gemini (Gemini Pro). This repository is ideal for AI enthusiasts, developers, and researchers exploring agent workflows, tool integrations, and collaborative AI behavior powered by the Gemini API.

## Project Overview

This repository includes real-world examples of building and orchestrating autonomous agents using CrewAI and Gemini. It demonstrates how to create single or multiple agents, enhance them with powerful tools, and enable intelligent task collaboration.

### Included Notebooks

| Notebook                  | Description                                                                  |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `agent.ipynb`             | Basic setup of a single CrewAI agent using Gemini API. Learn core concepts. |
| `agent_with_tools.ipynb`  | Enhance your agent with external tools.  |
| `multiple_agents.ipynb`   | Full-fledged multi-agent scenario with role-based collaboration.             |

## Powered by Gemini API

This project uses Google's Gemini-2.0-flash model via `GEMINI_API_KEY` for LLM capabilities, replacing OpenAI-based APIs. It is ideal for developers who want to leverage Google AI for custom workflows and intelligent automation.

## Features

- CrewAI agent setup using Gemini
- Tool-augmented agents with external integrations
- Multi-agent collaboration workflows
- Modular and beginner-friendly code
- Interactive, well-documented Jupyter Notebooks

## Use Cases Explored
Research automation using Gemini agents

Task delegation and parallel processing with multiple agents

Role-based agent collaboration (e.g., researcher, developer, summarizer)

Intelligent workflows using LLM reasoning and tools
